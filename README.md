# Experiment 02: Python Basics - Environment, Data Types, and Operators

## 1. Aim
The goal of this experiment is to get familiar with the Python programming setup. I'll be looking at how to run code in different modes, how variables work, understanding basic data types, and using different operators to perform calculations.

---

## 2. Objectives
* To explore the Python interface.
* To understand Python programming
* To learn how to write single-line and multi-line comments.
* To practice naming variables correctly and checking their data types.
* To use math, logic, and bitwise operators in a program.
* To take input from a user and show the results on the screen.

## 3. Theory

### Python Environment & Execution
I am using tools like **VS Code** and **Google Colab.** 

There are two main ways we run this code:
1.  **Interactive Mode:** This is like a chat. You type one line, press Enter, and you see the result immediately. It's great for testing small ideas.
2.  **Script Mode:** This is where we write a full program in a `.py` file and run it all at once. This is better for bigger projects.

### Comments
Comments are notes we leave for ourselves or other people. Python completely ignores them. 
* We use `#` for single line comment.
* We use triple quotes `"""` multi-line comments.

### Variables and Data Types
Variables are like boxes where we store data. In Python, we don't have to tell the computer if it's a number or text; it figures it out! 
* **Rules:** Names must start with a letter or `_`, they can't start with a number, and they are case-sensitive (`Age` is different from `age`).
* **Common Types:** * `int`: Whole numbers (10, 20).
    * `float`: Decimal numbers (99.9).
    * `str`: Text (always in "quotes").
    * `bool`: True or False logic.

### Operators
These are the symbols we use to do stuff with our data:
* **Arithmetic:** Basic math like `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`.
* **Relational:** Comparing things using `==`, `>`, or `<`.
* **Logical:** Using `and`, `or`, and `not` to check if multiple things are true.
* **Bitwise:** Special operators that work on the binary level (bits).

### Input/Output (I/O)
To make our program talk to us, we use `print()`. To get information from a user, we use `input()`. **Note:** Everything from `input()` comes in as text, so if we want to do math, we have to convert it using `int()` or `float()`.

## 4. Implementation (Code)

### Program 1: Comments and Interface
```python
# This is a single-line comment
# Program to demonstrate Python interface and comments


"""
This is a multi-line comment (docstring).
Python supports interactive and script modes.
"""
print("Welcome to Python Programming")
print("This program demonstrates comments and execution modes")
